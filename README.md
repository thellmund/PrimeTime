# PrimeTime
PrimeTime is an Android app that provides users with movie recommendations and release notifications.

## Background
Developing PrimeTime got me started with Android development in the summer of 2015. In 2019, I completely refactored the app in Kotlin and introduced Android Architecture Components, RxJava and dependency injection via Dagger 2.
